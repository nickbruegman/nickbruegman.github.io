    "text": "There is an age old argument in the world of UFC. Who truly is the best of the best? Many talk about the title defenses of champions, the knockout power of strikers, or the dominance of elite grapplers to debate the Greatest of All-Time. With the multiple weightclasses and various skill sets the sport displays, its difficult to truly compare fighters amoung weightclasses. However, I think it can be simplified. Just look at the stats.\nWhen looking at http://ufcstats.com we can breakdown each fighters career and what they have accomplished. I think we can all agree, to be considered the GOAT of a sport, you have to have a championship under your belt. So let’s look at all the present UFC champions as well as the past champions. (The past champions in this dataset all have atleast 1 title defense, current champions may not have a defense but that could be coming in their next fight)\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\n\nstats &lt;- ufc.stats::ufc_stats\n\ntrial &lt;- stats |&gt;

KOs and TKOs are done with strikes. This could be punches, kicks, elbows, knees, pretty much anyway you can hit someone hard with a part of your body. ##Submissions are when a fighter twist you up like a pretzel and you have to tap and give up. The most common is choking but it can also be applying pressure to a joint or body part. ##The decisions are when the fight goes to the full amount of rounds and the judges decide who won based on how they scored each round. ##So this seems pretty simple, the guy with the most wins should be the best right? Well with so many other factors in a fight, we can dive much deeper. Charles Oliveria may have 20+ wins, but what if he has 30 losses? (Spoiler: He doesn’t) ##Lets look at the at their wins in relation to loses, as well as finishes. Finishes account for KOs, TKOs, and Submissions. This mean that fighter was dominate in the cage. That’s what we are looking for.\n\n\nCode\nchart_1a &lt;- ufc_careers |&gt;\n  group_by(fighter) |&gt;\n  filter(fighter %in% champs) |&gt;\n  filter(Wins &gt; 5) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    Win_PCT,\n    Finish_PCT,\n    Wins\n    ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Win_PCT))\n\nchart_1b &lt;- ufc_careers |&gt;\n  group_by(fighter) |&gt;\n  filter(fighter %in% champs) |&gt;\n  filter(Wins &gt; 5) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    Win_PCT,\n    Finish_PCT,\n    Wins\n    ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Finish_PCT))\n\nC1_Top_5_WP &lt;- chart_1a |&gt;\n  top_n(5, wt=Win_PCT)\n\nC1_Top_5_FR &lt;- chart_1b |&gt;\n  top_n(5, wt=Finish_PCT)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data= chart_1a,\n    aes(x= Finish_PCT, y= Win_PCT, size= Wins),\n    alpha = .2) +\n  geom_point(\n    data= C1_Top_5_WP,\n    aes(x= Finish_PCT, y= Win_PCT, size= Wins),\n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data= C1_Top_5_FR,\n    aes(x= Finish_PCT, y= Win_PCT, size= Wins),\n    color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 50) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 50) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=C1_Top_5_WP,\n    aes(x=Finish_PCT, y=Win_PCT, label=fighter)) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=C1_Top_5_FR,\n    aes(x=Finish_PCT, y=Win_PCT, label=fighter)) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Finisn Rate\",\n    y = \"Win Percentage\",\n    title = \"The Most Wins and Finishes Ever in the UFC\",\n    subtitle = \"Red = Lots of Wins, Blue = Lots of Finishes\",\n    caption = \"Source: UFC | Graphic by Nick Bruegman\") + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12))\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 2, we can see that theres a lot of guys that win a large percentage of the fights they are in. For instance Khabib never lost a fight. He’s gotta be the GOAT right?!?! Well let’s look at the how many fights he finished. Not that many, he also didn’t have many wins compared to others in this discussion. ##A similar story is Tom Aspinall, and Luke Rockhold. They finsihed 100% of their wins but have a very small amount of them so that plays a factor into the percentage. ##But what if we looked at the guys that are in the top half of each category? 50% or better in both Winning % and Finsihing %? Let’s filter those top guys out and find another way to compare them. ##So looking back on finshes as a result to being dominate in the cage, we can look at what leads to these finsihes. For submissions, its takedowns. To wrestle or grapple with someone, it takes place on the ground. Takedowns lead to the ground and the ground game leads to submissions. For KOs and TKOs, it’s strikes like we discussed before. You could throw a lot of strikes but if they don’t hit your opponent or hit them in a vunerable spot, they probably won’t do much. ##Let’s take those top guys that win and finsih a lot, and then see how accurate they are with their methods of getting that finsih.\n\n\nCode\ngoats &lt;- ufc_careers |&gt;\n  group_by(fighter) |&gt;\n  filter(fighter %in% champs) |&gt;\n  filter(Win_PCT&gt;50) |&gt;\n  filter(Finish_PCT&gt;50) |&gt;\n  filter(Wins &gt; 10)\n\nchart_2a &lt;- goats |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    Sig_Strike_PCT,\n    Takedown_PCT,\n    Finishes) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Sig_Strike_PCT))\n\nchart_2b &lt;- goats |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    Sig_Strike_PCT,\n    Takedown_PCT,\n    Finishes) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(Takedown_PCT))\n\nt5_chart2a &lt;- chart_2a |&gt;\n  top_n(5, wt= Sig_Strike_PCT)\n\nt5_chart2b &lt;- chart_2b |&gt;\n  top_n(5, wt= Takedown_PCT)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data= chart_2a,\n    aes(x= Sig_Strike_PCT, y= Takedown_PCT, size= Finishes),\n    alpha = .2) +\n  geom_point(\n    data= t5_chart2a,\n    aes(x= Sig_Strike_PCT, y= Takedown_PCT, size= Finishes),\n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data= t5_chart2b,\n    aes(x= Sig_Strike_PCT, y= Takedown_PCT, size= Finishes),\n    color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 50) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 50) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=t5_chart2a,\n    aes(x= Sig_Strike_PCT, y= Takedown_PCT, label=fighter)) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=t5_chart2b,\n    aes(x= Sig_Strike_PCT, y= Takedown_PCT, label=fighter)) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Significant Strike PCT\",\n    y = \"Takedown PCT\",\n    title = \"Strikers v.

Former Middleweight Champion, Anderson Silva and current Lightweight Champion Islam Makhachev. They not only win and finish a whole lot,they do it in multiple ways. But if you look closely at their wins, Islam is lacking where Anderson is thriving.\nIt’s pretty clear that throughout Silvas career, he was dominate in the cage in multiple areas. He’s resume matches the stats as well. With a record in the UFC of 17 wins and only 7 losses, he defended his title 10 consecutive times and remains the longest regining champ the organization has ever seen (2457 days). With all the proof to back it up, Anderson Silva, is indeed the statistical, Pound-4-Pound #1 Fighter the UFC has ever seen."
